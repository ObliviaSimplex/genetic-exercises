GENLIN is an experimental linear genetic programming platform.
It is currently set up to work with just two benchmark datasets, 
but I plan on making it more flexible in the future, and perhaps
into something that might be useful as a linear GP library. 

In a nutshell: GENLIN uses natural selection to develop programmes,
written in a virtual machine code, to solve classification problems. 
The problems that the current version works with are not, in any
sense, interesting problems, but tweaking and observing an evolving
population of algorithms can be fun. 

To compile a standalone binary (assuming you have SBCL installed
somewhere on your system):

sbcl --script compile.lisp

This will generate a (large) binary file called "genlin". Run it, 
and follow the prompts. 

To run interactively, from the REPL:

sbcl --load genlin.lisp

Call (menu) to get a warm welcome, or just poke around and call 
the configuration and evolution functions directly, starting with
(setup). Setup takes many optional parameters. Consult the source
code for details.
